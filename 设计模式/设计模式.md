## opend/closed principle
open/closed principle states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

当需求变化时，你可以通过添加新的代码来扩展这个模块的行为，而不去更改那些已经存在的可以工作的代码
